I originally did the sketch for this drawing all the way back in October. It was
supposed to be for this big thing where Green contemplates what costume to pick
for Halloween, and a cheerleading outfit was one of them. Anyway, it would have
taken a lot of time and I'd have had to squeeze it all between work, school, and
the [commission](/art/crys-witch) I had taken on shortly after I started it.

My friend looked at the sketches I had, and she really liked this one. Since I
didn't have any big illustrations published for this month, I thought I'd do the
lineart and coloring before the year ended.

Who knows, maybe I'll finish them all in time for Halloween 2026. No promises,
though.

The outfit originally had a generic design in the sketch, but I changed it to a
[Starmies](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Baseball#In_animation) outfit
after the baseball team in the anime. We don't see a lot of Baseball cheerleaders
in the West it feels like, but they are an actual thing [in Japan](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/日本のプロ野球のマスコットガール・チアリーディングチーム一覧).

Merry Christmas, everybody!
