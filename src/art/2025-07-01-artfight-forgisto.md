I managed to remember that [Art Fight](https://artfight.net/) exists this year and participate. It's this fun little thing where, you draw other people's OCs, and others draw art of your OCs also.

This illustration is my first ever Art Fight attack, and features [purpurosea's](https://artfight.net/~purpurosea) Francisca Forgisto, who interns at a police station and whose superpower is being able to liquefy anything by touching it, into a sort of putty-like consistency.
