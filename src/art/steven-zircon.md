I drew this for a *Palentine's Art Exchange* on Bulbagarden Forums. Everyone 
signs up with a list of prompts they might want to see drawn by a randomly matched
forum user, which could involve canon Pokémon characters, OCs, or a mix of both.

The prompt I drew was of [Steven Stone](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Steven_Stone)
together with [Zircon](https://toyhou.se/29305709.zircon/108070499),
the Lati@s-inspired OC by my match. Their forum profile pic is Steven Stone at
the Safari Zone (I think), so I'm drawing for a real Steven fan.

I originally came up with this composition while at a board game shop with my
friends, while waiting for my turn in Power Grid. When there's about six of you
all a board game where you have to make complex decisions, the mid- to late-game
slows down to a crawl. One of my buddies, who takes the longest, adopts what I call
the *Game Winning Stance:* when it's his turn, he stands up and leans over the board,
propped up on the table by the left arm, and a handful of pretend money in the right.

Anyway, I wanted to go for a pose with really striking foreshortening, kinda like
with [Green in an Egg Chair](/art/green-egg/chair). The thing that really got me
onto the foreshortening thing are the illustrations in some of [KIRA and Giga's MVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbO4pg_LHUI),
which have really punchy visuals to match the tone of the music. In the end, my
foreshortening still ends up a little subdued, but I think the end result is
still dramatic enough, especially with the sunset lighting.
