Actually, this is the full [heraldic achievement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_(heraldry)),
not just the coat of arms, of Winston Archambault-Brewer, a Latin teacher fervently
keeping the language alive. He's a character I made for an RP.

Canonically, Winston's arms would have been granted sometime when he worked as a
translator of Latin mottoes for the Royal Heraldry Office of Kenawak.

The motto, *Maiores loquantur si audias,* translates to *Ancestors would speak,
if you listen.*

Anyways, it's really late and I'll think of the blazon and more to say on this
later. I'll edit this description here in the coming days.
