I managed to remember that [Art Fight](https://artfight.net/) exists this year and participate. It's this fun little thing where you draw other people's OCs, and others draw art of your OCs also.

This illustration features [dubiousdisc's](https://artfight.net/~dubiousdisc) Emmy, who is a Hatterene gijinka who's usually moody and on edge.

The style of this illustration is inspired by the visualizer in the MV of Moe Shop's [Silhouette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmiBM-7-tlk), which I was listening to at the time. I think it's turned out pretty nice!
