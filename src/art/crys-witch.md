It's October, and that means the Halloween season is upon us! Someone recently
commissioned a drawing of Crystal from Pok√©spe in a witch costume! I've drawn
her in a [steampunk outfit](/art/steampunk-crystal) before (which is also
available as a [sticker](https://www.redbubble.com/people/pilosophos/shop?iaCode=all-stickers)!),
and she always looks so cute in different outfits.
