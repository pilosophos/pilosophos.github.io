      Despite being a Star Trek fan, I've never seen Star Wars.
      The times I feel loneliest is when I'm surrounded by people.
      I can't stand horror movies.
      When I went to Japan, somtimes I didn't go into a restaurant unless I knew how to order something.
      I took a Latin class for four years in high school, but I barely remember any of it.
      Whenever I type Pokémon, I try to make sure to type it with the accent.
      Being stuck in a time loop might be pretty cool, at least for a while.
      I used to watch a lot of anime, but I haven't been keeping up with it anymore.
      One of the few free analog TV broadcasts when I was a kid was an oldies channel, so now I'm a fan of some ancient shows like Sanford & Son and McHale's Navy.
      I speak a language spoken by less than 100 people.
      Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to wanter the streets as a cat.
      I wish more things tasted the way they smell.
      Please do not touch me.
      I don't really like the taste of milk, but that's okay, because I'm lactose intolerant.
      Akira is just okay; Ghost in the Shell is better.
      I used to play Animal Crossing every day, and I feel kinda bad that I haven't been to my town in a while.
      I still miss Club Penguin.
      Discord is crap, but all my friends use it so I'm stuck there. But hey, at least it's not Line.
      I avoided a girl I liked for years because she had a boyfriend, but when I saw her again I realized I shouldn't have cared so much in the first place.
      When I was a kid, I signed up for SMWCentral forums and annoyed the hell out of everyone unintentionally.
      I don't like the overly shiny interior design in Strange New Worlds.
      The person I admire most is Fred Rogers, the host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.
      I like how I look in a hoodie, but I never wear them outside because a jacket is more practical.
      I love cyberpunk, but couldn't really get into solarpunk.
      I'd never admit out loud, but I really like nightcore.
      The only shonen anime I got into was Pokémon.
      I want to make music but I haven't put in enough practice to be good.
