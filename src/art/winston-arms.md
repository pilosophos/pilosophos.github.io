Actually, this is the full [heraldic achievement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_(heraldry)),
not just the coat of arms. They belong to a character I made for an RP,
Winston Archambault-Brewer, a Latin teacher fervently keeping the language alive.
He used to work as a Latin translator for the Royal Heraldry Office in his home
country, the Dominion of Kenawac.

A bunch of people were sharing flags of their RP characters' countries, and I
thought it would be cool to make some heraldry! I usually don't color using the
pencil brushes in Krita, but it turned out pretty well and I might try
using them a bit more.

## Blazon
### Arms
Azure, a barrel in middle chief proper, a wall embattled issuant from base Or
with an arched doorway and displaying an open book proper;

### Crest
A crest of a Roman Galea Gules;

### Motto
MAIORES LOQUANTUR SI AUDIAS. This latin phrase means "The ancestors would speak, if you listen".

## Symbolism
Winston Archambault-Brewer's arms contain a [cant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canting_arms),
referring to the two parts of his surname. Brewer, from his father
Geoffrey Brewer, is represented by the beer barrel. Archambault, from his mother
Jeanette Archambault, is represented by the arch.

The book and the crest of the Galea represents Winston's passion for Latin,
from authoring books on the Latin language, to his services for the
Royal Heraldry Office of Kenawac as a Latin translator.

The motto, meaning "The ancestors would speak, if you listen," refers to the
body of Latin texts written by our forebears that can only be properly
understood by learning the language.
