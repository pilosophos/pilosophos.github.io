Maybe it's not really a trenchcoat― I've never seen any trenchcoat with that mantle looking thing on the shoulders. But I thought I'd do a bit of an alternate costume for my Shadowrun character, [Camille](/ocs#camille), more fitting for the black trenchcoat Shadowrun playstyle. Less bright, maybe a little more discreet (though it's hard to be discreet with that robot arm of hers!).

By the way, how do you like the digital pencil style? Before I could afford a drawing tablet, I did art pretty much exclusively with pencil and paper. The pencil brush I'm using in Krita is alright, but I've resigned myself to knowing that it will never feel quite the same. Somehow, dragging lead across paper just feels *right*.
