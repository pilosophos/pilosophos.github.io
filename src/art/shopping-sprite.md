This is a faerie from my old worldbuilding project, Malaszec.

Before the Dovreijan Boom in the former Malaszec People's Republic, cohabitation with faeries was uncommon. When prospectors found that the faerie ward of Dovreija was not as desolate and worthless as once believed, Bigs started pouring in from the north, creating the first major era of cohabitation between faeries and Bigs.

One of many issues that arose from cohabitation was the size and weight of currency. Traditionally, two different sizes of the same currency were minted, and the small currency was almost always used only by faeries and vice versa. This system broke down after the Dovreijan Boom, since all currency was legal tender and everyone started circulating really impractical currency. This was decades before smartphones and smartwatches would be inveted, and the government had to devise physical currency that was practical to use, cost-effective to make, and hard to counterfeit.

The contemporary currency in the libertarian hellhole of Federal Malaszec is all digital, based off of a private blockchain among Malaszec's financial institutions. Users do payment like regular online banking using their bank's apps. On the back-end, each bank can make transactions with other banks and has a vote in the private blockchain to influence monetary policy.
