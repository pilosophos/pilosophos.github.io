Ever since the release of the Steam Deck, which allows you to play PC games on a
handheld game console, the distinction between a game console and PC has been
significantly blurred. But what if I told you that all the way back in the 1980s,
the difference between a PC and game console was already becoming indistinguishable,
and that the console we got in the West as the NES was supposed to be a general-purpose
computer?

## The Famicom: a Family Computer

While Nintendo had previously flirted with video games 
with the [Color TV-Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_TV-Game), home consoles
that could only play one game each, Nintendo really became a household name with the
Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), a system originally released in 1983 as the Family Computer,
or Famicom in Japan.

<WideShowcase>
  <img slot="showcased" src="/images/nes-article/famicom.png" alt="A picture of the Famicom." width="500"></img>

  The original Family Computer, or Famicom.
  The NES that we got in the West was redesigned to resemble a VCR and came with a [robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.O.B.),
  to distance itself from game consoles after the
  [American Video Game Crash of 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983).
</WideShowcase>

The name *Family Computer* alludes to the fact that it was originally envisioned
as a computer *masquerading* as a toy by Nintendo's late president, [Hiroshi Yamauchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Yamauchi).
This would make the Famicom less intimidating than a PC and would be something even kids could have fun with.
He appointed [Masayuki Uemura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayuki_Uemura) as head of Nintendo R&D2,
the new hardware division of the company, to design what would become the Famicom.

<HasMarginalNote>
  Since the Famicom was intended to be useful as a general-purpose computer,
  part of its basic design was a chip that would allow peripherals to
  talk directly to the CPU― anything from keyboards, to modems, to disk drives.

  <aside slot="marginal-note">
    I'm unsure whether this "chip" for talking to the CPU is a [feature](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/CPU_interrupts)
    of the CPU itself, or whether it's an actual separate chip.
  </aside>
</HasMarginalNote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "It was why the machine would later be called Yamauchi's Trojan Horse: It
    slipped into living rooms with nothing but a pair of controllers, innocently
    toylike, yet it included the capability to do far more than play games."

## Famicom addons

<HasMarginalImg>
  Sure enough in 1984, a year after its release, consumers got [Family BASIC](https://www.mariowiki.com/Family_BASIC),
  which let anyone program the Famicom using its dialect of the BASIC programming language.
  It included a keyboard that connected to the [expansion port](https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/27664/nintendos-expansion-ports)
  in front of the console to make programming easier.

  <img slot="img" src="/images/nes-article/family-basic.png" alt="A picture of the Family BASIC cartridge, with keyboard" width="400"></img>
  <figcaption slot="caption">The Family BASIC cartridge and included Famicom Keyboard.</figcaption>
</HasMarginalImg>

Out of the box, it came included with a few programs: *Calculation Board*, a calculator,
*Music Board*, a music sequencer, and *Message Board*, for writing notes. A nearly identical version of Family BASIC, called Playbox BASIC, released for the [Sharp C1](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Sharp_C1) TV-plus-Famicom combo system, comes with *Biorhythm Board* instead of Message Board.

<WideShowcase>
  <img slot="showcased" src="/images/nes-article/biorhythm-board.png" alt="Manual page for Sample Program 8" width="500"></img>

  Biorhythm Board tried to predict fluctuations in your physiological,
  emotional, and intellectual state using psuedoscientific
  [biorhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythm_(pseudoscience)).
  Other than replacing Message Board, Playbox BASIC was otherwise identical
  to Family BASIC.

  </cite>
</WideShowcase>


<HasMarginalImg>

  It also had a manual that showed you how
  to make eight different sample games with BASIC, including *Route 66*, a top-down driving
  game, *Type Master*, a typing game, and *Sample Program 8*, which the manual insists is just a tech demo, not a game.

      <p class="text-sm">For Penpen, this is a matter of life or death.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Many third-party games and programs made in Family BASIC were distributed in books and magazines like [Program Pochette](https://archive.org/details/program-pochette-84-volume-1), [Micom Basic](https://archive.org/details/micom-basic-1984-09-ozidual) and [many more](https://ozidual.github.io/FamilyBasicTracking/Main.html). Like the examples in the Family BASIC manual, these were lines of source code that you would have to type into your Famicom manually in order to run.

<HasMarginalNote>
  While typing the full code to a program may seem tedious to us today, this was
  a fairly common way to distribute programs at the time,
  including for the [best selling](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/72695-most-computer-sales) desktop computer of all time, the [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64).

  <aside slot="marginal-note">
    See <a href="https://archive.org/details/more-than-32-basic-programs-for-the-commodore-64"><i>More Than 32 BASIC Programs for the Commodore 64</i></a> for some examples in English.
  </aside>
</HasMarginalNote>

Although most of the examples focused on games, Family BASIC was a complete
programming language, so you could make anything you wanted. If you knew how the
hardware worked (or were patient enough to figure it out), you could even unlock
the Famicom's full power by calling low-level CPU instructions with the `CALL`
function.

<div class="relative">

  Alongside Family BASIC, you could also buy the [Famicom Data Recorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famicom_Data_Recorder), to save
  your programs to a cassette tape. This was identical to a normal tape deck, on which
  you would hook up the microphone and speaker ports to corresponding ports on the
  Famicom Keyboard. 

  <figure class="flex flex-col text-center items-center marginal-note">

    <figcaption>
      The Famicom Data Recorder is cassette deck that says Nintendo on it.
      Other than printed source code, cassettes were another popular way to
      share programs on home computers, [Commodore 64 included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

It wasn't until the release of the [Famicom Disk System](https://www.mariowiki.com/Family_Computer_Disk_System)
that the Famicom could use floppy disks. Rather than normal floppy disks however,
Nintendo came out with a proprietary disk format called the *Disk Card*, which
slotted into the disk drive part of the addon.


<figure class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-3 xl:flex-row xl:w-280">
  <img src="/images/nes-article/fds.png" alt="A picture of Famicom Disk System" width="380" class="me-3"></img>

      The Famicom Disk System addon consists of two parts connected by a cable: The disk drive where you insert Disk Cards (bottom), and a RAM adapter which slots into the Famicom cartridge slot (top).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<HasMarginalNote>
  Since the Famicom Disk System occupied the cartridge slot used by Family BASIC,
  there was no officially supported way to save BASIC programs to a Disk Card.
  It took until the year official support ended for the
  Famicom Disk System in 2007 that Japanese console modders found a way to do so.

  <aside slot="marginal-note">
    <p class="mt-0!">You can read the <a href="http://gameidiri.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2007/02/basic_f283.html">2007 article</a> in Japanese,
    or a modern version of the mod on the <a href="https://github.com/TakuikaNinja/FC-DiskBASIC">FC-DiskBASIC</a> Github.</p>
    <p>And yes, Nintendo really offered technical support for the FDS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021081932/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/repair/price.html#uketsuke_syuryo">until 2007</a>.</p>

<div class="relative">
  The main use of a Disk Card was to take it
  to Disk Writer kiosks at game stores where, for just ¥500 <span class="muted">(~US$4.46 in 2025)</span>, you could overwrite it
  with a new game from Nintendo. With disks being cheaper than Famicom cartridge games, and with
  game cartridge rental becoming functionally illegal with the [Japan Copyright Act of 1984](https://kotaku.com/why-you-cant-rent-games-in-japan-5914749),
  the Famicom Disk System managed to sell 4.4 million units before it sales ended in 1993.

    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Certain Disk Writer kiosks were also fax enabled. Some Disk Card games would
write your scores to the disk, and you would take it to one of these Disk Fax
kiosks to fax your scores to Nintendo, allowing you to participate in a
nationwide leaderboard. It's a bit of a stretch, but you could arguably call this
Nintendo's first "online gaming" service.

## Famicom Network System

<HasMarginalImg>
  Yamauchi was a staunch believer in Nintendo as more than just a game company―
  he wanted his company to be a *key player* in the upcoming Information Age. In
  a speech given to his employees, he proclaimed:

  <img slot="img" src="/images/nes-article/famicom-modem.jpg" alt="A picture of a Famicom Network System peripheral" width="280"></img>
  <figcaption slot="caption">A Famicom Network System modem attached to a Famicom.</figcaption>

</HasMarginalImg>

<blockquote>
  "From now on, our purpose is not only to develop new exciting entertainment software
but to provide information that can be efficiently used in each household."
  <cite class="not-italic text-sm block">Translation from <i>Game Over, Press Start to Continue: How Nintendo Conquered the World</i>, p. 77.</cite>
</blockquote>

The keystone to this vision was the Famicom Network System, developed
in cooperation with Nomura Securities, a stock brokering company.
Nintendo would build a modem for the Famicom, and Nomura Securities would build
a database that could be reached using the modem to access up-to-date stock market
data.

<figure class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-3 xl:flex-row xl:w-280">
  <img src="/images/nes-article/network-diagram.jpg" alt="A diagram of the Famicom Network System" width="500" class="me-3"></img>
  <figcaption class="font-display">
    <p>
      Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access">dial-up internet</a>, the Famicom Modem used
      a phone line to connect Famicoms to services on the network. Data would be encoded as sound and travel through the telephone line,
      and finally decoded back into data by the modem.
    </p>
    <cite class="text-sm">Image source: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230201205244/https://glitterberri.com/developing-the-famicom-modem/">Developing the Famicom Modem</a> in <i>Nikkei Electronics</i>, translated by Glitterberri</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

According to Uemura Masayuki, Nintendo R&D2 "wasn't confident that they would
be able to make network games entertaining," but with Nomura Securities handling
development of the database, Nintendo figured that the infrastructure would
already be in place and they could figure out making online games fun later.
Ultimately, this meant that few games were actually released for the Famicom Network System
aside from Konami's [*Tsuushin Shogi Club*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWM3ScYfDDU).

<div class="relative">

  Instead, the Famicom Network System launched with exciting titles like
  *Nomura no Famicom Trade*, which allowed you to trade on the stock market. You
  would insert the *Tsuushin Cartridge* <span class="muted">("Communication Cartridge")</span> into the modem,
  and with the number pad on the Famicom Network System's special controller, you
  could choose which stocks you wanted and in what quantity.

<div class="relative">
  The most popular use of the Famicom Network System was gambling on
  horse races with *JRA-PAT,* or *JRA Personal Access Terminal,* developed by the
  [Japan Racing Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Racing_Association).
  It was so successful that it captured 35% of the Japanese horse betting market,
  competing with PCs and dedicated betting terminals.

  <aside class="marginal-note">
    [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mNGU0j4sYg) recorded in 2008
    shows JRA-PAT in operation. Despite the Famicom Network System being
    discontinued in 1991, JRA-PAT remained usable until 2015.

</div>

<div class="relative">

  Unfortunately, much of the software released to use the Famicom Network System has
  become lost media since the network was taken down. For instance, there are Japanese
  newspapers mentioning *Post Transfer Home Service* for dealing
  with the post office, *Cattleya AV Club* for buying CDs, and a program for
  buying clothes, but the whereabouts of these cartridges are unknown.

  <aside class="marginal-note">

There's also the Famicom Fitness System, developed jointly with Fukuoka University and
a few other companies, that allowed the Famicom to read data from an exercise
bike. It was marketed to fitness gyms and medical institutions, and was scheduled
to be marketed to the general public in December 1990, but it is unknown if this
ever happened.

What eventually killed the Famicom Network System was the onset of the
[Lost Decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decades), a period of
nationwide economic stagnation, starting in the early 90s. With stock trading
comprising much the Famicom Network's traffic, consumers' plummeting interest in
stocks was the final nail in the coffin for a service that was already
difficult to set up and use.

<HasMarginalImg>
  In the West, Nintendo hoped to create a similar network to the
  Famicom Network System in the United States with partners like
  AT&T and Fidelity Investments, but the idea came under fire when a program to play
  the Minnesota State Lottery was announced. Concerns over underage gambling were
  raised, and the NES modem was killed before making it to market.

## Legacy

<HasMarginalImg>
  Despite its demise, some of the ideas behind the Famicom Network System were
  recycled for the Satellaview, a satellite service for the Super Famicom (known as the
  Super Nintendo in the West). Satellaview allowed users to receive satellite
  broadcasts to download games, magazines, and other media.

  <img slot="img" src="/images/nes-article/satellaview.jpg" width="250"></img>

</HasMarginalImg>

The horse betting program JRA-PAT, being one of the most popular applications,
was [re-released](https://www.raphnet.net/divers/retro_challenge_2018_09/index_en.php) for the Super Famicom. As time marched on, internet connectivity
became the norm with consoles like the Sega Dreamcast, which had an inbuilt
modem and yet another re-release of JRA-PAT that had [excellent music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeZw7qU2ju4).

Nowadays, we often take both our PCs and the internet for granted. Everywhere we
go, we are constantly connected to services that let us do everything the Famicom
could do and more. But for a time, not every home had a PC.
You might just have a TV, a landline telephone, and a Famicom that was more than
meets the eye.

## Your game consoles are so much more

Even though Nintendo no longer designs game consoles to be general-purpose computers,
most game consoles nowadays are essentially PCs with specialized gaming hardware.

The [original Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)) (short for DirectX Box),
is really just an x86 Intel Pentium PC with a customized version of Windows for gaming.

<HasMarginalImg>
  Linux on the Playstation 2 and 3 were *officially supported* by Sony with [PS2 Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_for_PlayStation_2)
  and [OtherOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS). This was such a useful
  feature that researchers built [compute clusters using PS3s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_cluster) to speed up black hole
  simulations, cryptography research, and analyzing satellite imagery. When Sony
  removed the OtherOS feature in 2010, a [class-action lawsuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20160322110301/http://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/12043-appellate-court-puts-ps3-class-action-lawsuit-back-game/) was brought against them,
  proving that people really did care about Linux on their game consoles.

The Nintendo Switch is an ARM-based computer capable of dual-booting into Linux
and Android with [Switchroot](https://switchroot.org/). Using Linux on the Switch is great because
you can carry it around to do most things you'd do with a PC, and it even comes with
a convenient dock so you can connect it with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor when
you're at home.

The catch? Nintendo makes it as hard as humanly possible to do so. Developers had
to hack the device by [shorting two pins](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/hardware/researcher-discloses-unpatchable-nintendo-switch-exploit/)
on the Joycon connector to gain access the bootloader and install other OSes. When this was publicized, Nintendo changed the hardware so you now
need to [install a modchip](https://switch.hacks.guide/user_guide/modchip/) to do so, requiring incredibly precise microsoldering skills.

In our hands, we hold the ghost of Nintendo's dream: a Nintendo computer in
every home that could be your portal to the world's information. In a way,
Nintendo got that wish― it's just not profitable for them anymore.
