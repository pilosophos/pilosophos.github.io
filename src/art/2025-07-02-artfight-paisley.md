I managed to remember that [Art Fight](https://artfight.net/) exists this year and participate. It's this fun little thing where, you draw other people's OCs, and others draw art of your OCs also.

This illustration features [sleepwick](https://artfight.net/~sleepwick)'s Paisley, a Pok√©mon trainer from the Galar. I've not played Sword and/or Shield, but when I think of Galar, I think of *Wooloo* and *trains*, and this advertisement kind of just popped out.

"See Britain by train" is an old British Rail advertising campaign as seen on [this poster](https://cdn.freewebstore.com/origin/259990/warwick_castle_see_britain_by_train_bagley_1726429907303.jpg) ([Archived link](https://cdn.freewebstore.com/origin/259990/warwick_castle_see_britain_by_train_bagley_1726429907303.jpg)), and "We're getting there" is an old BR slogan as seen in this [TV ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGyhDjQCLkY).

What always amuses me about "We're getting there" is that it implies BR isn't very good and it's like them saying "really trying you guys!"
