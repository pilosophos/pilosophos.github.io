Here's a little sketch I did today! I've been playing [Life Is Strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Strange)
recently, a game which I saw all the time on the Xbox 360 Marketplace but never
got to play until now.

This would be the second time-travel multiple-endings game I've played since
[Steins;Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steins;Gate) forever ago. I do love
me some story-driven gameplay and branching paths, hence my love of visual novels,
so I've been enjoying the game so far.

The main character is Max Caulfield, an adorable but meek high school girl who loves
photography. She's cute, but so embroiled in the dramatic high school environment
that she lacks the self-esteem to see it.

She kind of reminds me of Riki, the main character in [Little Busters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Busters!) (my
favorite VN of all time), since she's got a shy personality that's often
overshadowed by the dominant personalities of those around her. Riki would deny
it, but he's also pretty adorable.

Life Is Strange's controls feel a bit sluggish (I'm playing on a Nintendo Switch)
which discourages me from interacting with the environment, even though I'm the
kind of guy who taps on every single little object in the Phoenix Wright
investigation segments. Same with the time travel, which is unfortunate; part
of the fun of visual novels is exploring all the different choices and routes,
but Life is Strange is a 3D adventure game, so you can't really go back and forth
to try new things as fluidly as a VN.

I'm on Episode 3 of the game, and it kind of worries me that no matter what
choices I make, I'm still being railroaded through a set storyline with Chloe and
the disappearance of Rachel. For instance:

<details>
  <summary class="link">Life Is Strange: Episode 2 spoilers</summary>

  Kate's story feels more like a momentary distraction from Chloe and Rachel's
  main storyline. Regardless of the outcome of Kate's subplot, it seems like you
  *will* discover what happened to Rachel sooner or later, because that's what
  the game is setting you up for. If Kate dies, the story just kind of moves on.

What would sadden me a little is if, for all the emphasis the game places on chaos
theory and the consequences of choices, the endings are just slight variations of "you solve the
mystery" and "you fail to solve the mystery." So rather than reaching
*Kate's Good/Bad Ending,* you end up at *Rachel and Chloe's Good/Bad Ending* no
matter what you do, with a footnote about what happened to Kate and the other
characters. Compare this with Fallout 3:

  <summary class="link">Fallout 3 spoilers</summary>

  Despite Fallout 3 having hundreds of ending variations, the only one that
  really matters is the main story's. Regardless of whether you choose to blow
  up Megaton is largely irrelevant to the search for Dad and Project Purity. As
  far as the ending is concerned, all it does it change a few slides of the final
  montage. The number of endings are due to combinatorics, not because there are
  actually hundreds of deep plotlines.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the many storylines of the visual novels I've played.
