        <p>
          Camille is a hacker-for-hire who will work for anyone with enough cash, whether for good or for evil. She is often known as "Rosy" for wearing rose-tinted glasses, which are purely for fashion. She became ambidextrous after having replaced her previously non-dominant right arm with a cybernetic one, which she did because "it just seemed cool at the time".
        </p>
        
        <p>
          She enjoys clubbing and loud raves, and finds any room where she can hear herself speak to be too quiet. Occasionally, she can be seen amusing herself by flying drones at people as they run away in terror. Though calm and capable in a gunfight, she is deathly afraid of wasps and once unloaded a magazine into a black-and-yellow marble.
        </p>

        <p>
          Camille is a character I made for the tabletop RPG <i>Shadowrun</i>, which is a cyberpunk setting where magic started to spring up on Earth one day resulting in the appearance of elves, orcs, and dragons.

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Though nicknamed after her rose-tinted glasses, her most noticeable feature is her cyberarm, which she likes to show off. She is often depicted wearing a head-mounted software-defined radio with an integrated earpiece, which can be connected using a cable to the cyberdeck she carries around, slung over her shoulder.</p>

        <p>Since Camille was created as a design challenge― to make a Shadowrun character that looks like she's actually from Seattle― she wears clothes that can stand up to at least light rain and offers good wind coverage. For instance, she is mainly depicted with an REI windbreaker and high-heeled boots that resemble hiking boots. See the design checklist for more details on her clothes and accessories.</p>

        <p>
          Val is a first-year Ph.D at Orange Islands University student studying biochemistry. Before leaving for her summer study abroad in San Isidore, she was doing research with her doctoral advisor, <a class="link" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Orange_Islands">Dr. Philena Ivy</a>, on the protein expression in regional Pokémon variants. One day, Dr. Ivy brought back a <a class="link" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Totodile">Totodile</a> named Kyle to the lab in the Orange Islands, who quickly took to Val, and is often seen hiding stolen snacks or being chased around the lab by Val for running off with a PCR tray as a prank.
        </p>

        <p>
          As she lives on a graduate stipend, she is constantly broke and can often be found circling the campus for seminars with free food. Though quite resourceful, Val is a chronic procrastinator, to the point where she originally sought a study abroad to exploit a loophole in her university's policies that would let her postpone her Ph.D qualifying exams. Dr. Ivy entrusted Val with Kyle, who she took to San Isidore to give the rest of the lab members a period of peace, and Kyle was practically more Val's Pokémon than Dr. Ivy's anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          Val is a character I made for a tabletop RPG set in the Pokémon universe that was being run by a friend of mine, that abruptly ended in the middle. The RPG was set in San Isidore, a city in the Sotona region, which was made for the RPG.

        <p>She is often seen with an orange OIU hoodie, light blue jeans, and red sneakers. She is quite fond of her lab coat, and often "forgets" to take it off when not in the lab. The lapel of her lab coat sports a <a class="link" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Badge#Orange_League">Coral-Eye Badge</a>, received for Kyle's superior accuracy at the <a class="link" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mikan_Gym">Mikan Gym's</a> water gun challenge, a performance Val has struggled to get out of Kyle since.</p>

        <p>When out and about, she carries a messenger bag full of Pokéblocks, N95 masks, spare gloves, a notebook, leftover food from on-campus seminars, an Up Ramen™, and a corporate-branded Premier Ball given out at a career fair. Since the start of her study abroad, she carries a first-generation Pokédex with the label "PROPERTY OF OIU BIOCHEMISTRY," which was provided by Dr. Ivy, but is quite old and glitches out often.</p>

        <p>She can be excited by new clothes, especially if they're kind of weird, such as Australian cork hats or skirts with lots of digits of <i>pi</i> printed on them, but she usually ends up going back to a lab coat, hoodie, and jeans ensemble eventually.</p>
