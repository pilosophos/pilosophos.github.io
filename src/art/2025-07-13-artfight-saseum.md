I managed to remember that [Art Fight](https://artfight.net/) exists this year and participate. It's this fun little thing where, you draw other people's OCs, and others draw art of your OCs also.

This illustration features [Nerikaen's](https://artfight.net/~Nerikaen), who is a Shadowrun character with antlers implanted into her skull. For this one, I decided to look at some fashion photography magazines to look for some cool poses, like the Jojo manga artist does, and I think the aloofness of the pose I settled on really suits her.
