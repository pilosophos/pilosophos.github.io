I drew Mia Fey in a bunnysuit again!

Apparently Mia's attraction to Lana (which, according to Ema is purely "intellectual attraction") happened because of a localization thing, so to Japanese viewers her reaction is going to seem completely random.

Also isn't mouse Maya so adorable? I wanna hug her omg.
