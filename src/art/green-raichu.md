This was a commission from a client, who requested Green(f) in a Raichu costume,
kinda like her [Pikachu costume](https://corocoro.tv/pokesp/story/comic/character/blue/blue.html).
Thanks for the commission!

Green is one of my favorite Pokéspe characters (next to Diamond), and I had
an absolute blast drawing this one. Green's design is based off of some [post-ORAS
chapter illustrations](https://old.reddit.com/r/Luckyshipping/comments/1pzrxgw/real_hidden_postoras_luckyshipping_lore/),
after she starts wearing a black dress again. Her hair's a little bit rounder,
and her boots a bit pointier. It's a subtle difference
from her original design.

By the way, ORAS chapter was originally released online, chapter by chapter, by
Shogakukan, from December 2014 to September 2016. After being released this way,
either in magazines or digitally, Pokémon Adventures chapters for that arc are
collected into volume releases, which may contain extra chapters, story changes,
and bonus illustrations. The volume releases are how we're used to reading manga
in the West. ([Source](https://old.reddit.com/r/pokespe/comments/1kximrw/serious_explaining_the_volumization_of_pok%C3%A9mon/))

It turns out that, 10 years after its original release, ORAS chapter is still
trying to put together [Volume 65](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures_volume_65),
having been delayed for multiple years.

I've only read the magazine releases (and that was a long time ago), so if I
ever start reading the volumes, I might be in for big surprises! Whenever I go
on the Pokéspe subreddit and see ORAS chapter stuff that I've never seen,
I always wonder if I hit my head and lost all memory since I originally read it.
This is why.
