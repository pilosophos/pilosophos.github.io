I drew this for Bulbagarden Forums' Pokémon 30th Anniversary Bingo. There was a
community Bingo card with a bunch of themes like "Strange Friends", "Favorite Character",
and "Going Home", and users would collectively fill it in by drawing art or writing
a fic with that theme. The theme I chose was *"Too much water!"*

I wasn't originally going to post this outside the forum, but after I drew it,
I figured... it was just too adorable not to!
