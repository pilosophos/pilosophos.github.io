        <p>
          Camille is a hacker-for-hire who will work for anyone with enough cash, whether for good or for evil. She is often known as "Rosy" for wearing rose-tinted glasses, which are purely for fashion. She became ambidextrous after having replaced her previously non-dominant right arm with a cybernetic one, which she did because "it just seemed cool at the time".
        </p>
        
        <p>
          She enjoys clubbing and loud raves, and finds any room where she can hear herself speak to be too quiet. Occasionally, she can be seen amusing herself by flying drones at people as they run away in terror. Though calm and capable in a gunfight, she is deathly afraid of wasps and once unloaded a magazine into a black-and-yellow marble.
        </p>

        <p>
          Camille is a character I made for the tabletop RPG <i>Shadowrun</i>, which is a cyberpunk setting where magic started to spring up on Earth one day resulting in the appearance of elves, orcs, and dragons.

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Though nicknamed after her rose-tinted glasses, her most noticeable feature is her cyberarm, which she likes to show off. She is often depicted wearing a head-mounted software-defined radio with an integrated earpiece, which can be connected using a cable to the cyberdeck she carries around, slung over her shoulder.</p>

        <p>Since Camille was created as a design challenge― to make a Shadowrun character that looks like she's actually from Seattle― she wears clothes that can stand up to at least light rain and offers good wind coverage. For instance, she is mainly depicted with an REI windbreaker and high-heeled boots that resemble hiking boots. See the design checklist for more details on her clothes and accessories.</p>
