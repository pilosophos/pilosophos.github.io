Actually, this is the full [heraldic achievement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_(heraldry)),
not just the coat of arms. They belong to a character I made for an RP,
Winston Archambault-Brewer, a Latin teacher fervently keeping the language alive.

Canonically, Winston's arms would have been granted sometime when he worked as a
translator of Latin mottoes for the Royal Heraldry Office of Kenawak.

These are [canting arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canting_arms) which make
a rebus out of the two halves his surname: a barrel for *Brewer*, and an arch
for *Archambault*.

I was thinking that the design of his arms would also be related to the arms of
his childhood school that his mother is a headmaster of. I have a design in mind,
but I have yet to emblazon it.

The motto, *Maiores loquantur si audias,* translates to *Ancestors would speak,
if you listen.*

Anyways, it's really late and I'll think of the blazon and more to say on this
later. I'll edit this description here in the coming days.
