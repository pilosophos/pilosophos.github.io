I recently took part in an online debate about whether Nintendo and other game
console manufacturers should allow modding. One question that came up during
this was whether or not there is a clear distinction between a game console and
a personal computer. While researching this question, I came across a lot of
interesting peripherals and software for using the Nintendo Entertainment System
for more than just for games, from programming in BASIC to trading stocks.

## The Famicom: a Family Computer

While Nintendo had previously flirted with video games 
with the [Color TV-Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_TV-Game), home consoles
that could only play one game each, Nintendo became a household name with the
Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), originally released in 1983 as the Family Computer,
or Famicom in Japan.

      The NES that we got in the West looks completely different, like a VCR,
      to distance itself from game consoles due to the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983">Video Game Crash of 1983</a> in the United States.

</figure>

The name *Family Computer* alludes to the fact that
it was originally envisioned by Nintendo's late president, [Hiroshi Yamauchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Yamauchi),
as a computer *masquerading* as a toy. This would make the Famicom less intimidating
than a PC and would be something even kids could have fun with.
He appointed [Masayuki Uemura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayuki_Uemura) as head of Nintendo R&D2,
the new hardware division of the company, to design what would become the Famicom.

Since the Famicom was intended to be useful as a general purpose computer,
part of its basic design was a chip that would allow peripherals to
talk directly to the CPU― anything from keyboards, to modems, to disk drives.

TODO: which chip is this?

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "It was why the machine would later be called Yamauchi's Trojan Horse: It
    slipped into living rooms with nothing but a pair of controllers, innocently
    toylike, yet it included the capability to do far more than play games."

## Family BASIC, Data Recorder, and Disk System

<div class="relative">

Sure enough in 1984, a year after its release, consumers got [Family BASIC](https://www.mariowiki.com/Family_BASIC),
which let anyone program the Famicom using its dialect of the
BASIC programming language,
plus the included Famicom keyboard that connected to the [expansion port](https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/27664/nintendos-expansion-ports)
in front of the console.

Family BASIC came with a few programs: *Calculation Board*, a calculator,
*Music Board*, a music sequencer, and *Message Board*, for writing notes. A nearly identical version of Family BASIC, called Playbox BASIC, released for the [Sharp C1](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Sharp_C1) TV-plus-Famicom combo system comes with *Biorhythm Board* instead of Message Board.

  It also had a manual that showed you how
  to make eight different sample games with BASIC, including *Route 66*, a top-down driving
  game; *Type Master*, a typing game; and *Sample Program 8*, a game where Penpen grabs
  flags while evading a Nitanita, which the manual insists is just a tech demo, not a game.

Many third-party games and programs made in Family BASIC were distributed in books and magazines like [Program Pochette](https://archive.org/details/program-pochette-84-volume-1), [Micom Basic](https://archive.org/details/micom-basic-1984-09-ozidual) and [many more](https://ozidual.github.io/FamilyBasicTracking/Main.html). Like the examples in the Family BASIC manual, these were lines of source code that you would have to type into your Famicom manually in order to run.

<div class="relative">

  While typing the full code to a program may seem tedious to us today, this was
  a fairly common way to distribute programs for computers at the time,
  including the [best selling](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/72695-most-computer-sales) desktop computer of all time, the [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64).

  <aside class="marginal-note">

Although most of the examples focused on games, since Family BASIC was a complete
programming language, you could make anything you wanted. In fact, using the `CALL`
instruction, you could take full advantage of the CPU by making low-level system
calls that weren't normally available.

<div class="relative">

  Alongside Family BASIC, you could also buy the [Famicom Data Recorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famicom_Data_Recorder), to save
  your programs to a cassette tape. This was identical to a normal tape deck, on which
  you would hook up the microphone and speaker ports to corresponding ports on the
  Famicom Keyboard.

</div>

It wasn't until the release of the [Famicom Disk System](https://www.mariowiki.com/Family_Computer_Disk_System)
that the Famicom could use floppy disks. Rather than normal floppy disks however,
Nintendo came out with a proprietary disk format called the *Disk Card*, which
slotted into the disk drive part of the addon.


<figure class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-3 xl:flex-row xl:w-280">
  <img src="/images/nes-article/fds.png" alt="A picture of Famicom Disk System" width="380" class="me-3">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="relative">

  Since the Famicom Disk System occupied the cartridge slot used by Family BASIC,
  there was no officially supported way to save BASIC programs to a Disk Card.
  It took until the year official support ended for the
  Famicom Disk System in 2007 that Japanese console modders found a way to do so.

    <p>And yes, Nintendo offered technical support for the FDS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021081932/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/repair/price.html#uketsuke_syuryo">until 2007</a>.</p>

  The main use of a Disk Card was to take it
  to Disk Writer kiosks at game stores where, for just ¥500 <span class="muted">(at the time, ~US$3.25)</span>, you could overwrite it
  with a new game from Nintendo. With disks being cheaper than Famicom cartridge games, and with
  game cartridge rental becoming functionally illegal with the [Japan Copyright Act of 1984](https://kotaku.com/why-you-cant-rent-games-in-japan-5914749),
  the Famicom Disk System managed to sell 4.4 million units before it stopped being
  sold in 1993.

  </figure>
</div>

Certain games would write save data to the Disk Card, and you could even participate
in nationwide leaderboards by inserting it into a Disk Fax kiosk to fax your
scores to Nintendo. You might even call this Nintendo's first "online gaming" service.

## Famicom Network System

Yamauchi was a staunch believer in Nintendo as more than just a game company―
he wanted his company to be a *key player* in the upcoming Information Age. In
a speech given to his employees, he proclaimed:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "From now on, our purpose is not only to develop new exciting entertainment software
but to provide information that can be efficiently used in each household."
  </p>

  <cite class="not-italic text-sm">Translation from *Game Over, Press Start to Continue: How Nintendo Conquered the World* by David Sheff & Andy Eddy, p. 77.</cite>
</blockquote>

<div class="relative">

  The keystone to this vision was the Famicom Network System, developed
  in cooperation with Nomura Securities, a stock trading company.
  Nintendo would build a modem for the Famicom, and Nomura Securities would build
  a database that could be reached using the modem to access up-to-date stock market
  data.

  <figure class="flex flex-col text-center items-center marginal-note">

  <figcaption class="font-display">
    <p>
      Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access">dial-up internet</a>, the Famicom Modem used
      a phone line to connect Famicoms to services on the network.
    </p>

According to Uemura Masayuki, Nintendo R&D2 "wasn't confident that they would
be able to make network games entertaining," but with Nomura Securities handling
development of the database, Nintendo figured that the infrastructure would
already be in place and they could figure out making online games fun later.
Ultimately, this meant that few games were actually released for the Famicom Network System
aside from Konami's *Tsuushin Shogi Club*.

Instead, the Famicom Network System launched with exciting titles like
*Nomura no Famicom Trade*, which allowed you to trade on the stock market. You
would insert the *Tsuushin Cartridge* <span class="muted">("Communication Cartridge")</span> into the modem,
and with the number pad on the Famicom Network System's special controller, you
could choose which stocks you wanted and in what quantity.

Following release, a number of other financial companies wanted in on the action,
leading to *Cosmo no Famicom Trade,* *Shin Nihon no Famicom Trade,* and
*Kangyo Sumimaru no Famicom Trade,* among others.

The most popular use of the Famicom Network System was gambling on
horse races run by the [Japan Racing Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Racing_Association)
with *JRA-PAT,* the JRA Personal Access Terminal. It was so successful that it
captured 35% of the Japanese horse betting market, competing with PCs and dedicated betting terminals.

Unfortunately, much of the software released to use the Famicom Network System has
become lost media since the network was taken down. For instance, there are Japanese
news articles and advertisements for titles like *Post Transfer Home Service* for dealing
with the post office, or *Cattleya AV Club* for buying CDs, and software for
buying clothes. If you find them, the folks at [lostmediawiki.com](https://lostmediawiki.com/Family_Computer_Network_System/TV-NET_(partially_found_ROM_and_peripherals_of_telecommunication_service_for_Famicom;_1987-1991))
would be very interested.

There are also systems which were marketed to the general public but possibly
never sold, including the Famicom Fitness System, developed by Nintendo,
Fukuoka University, and Bridgestone <span class="muted">(the tire company)</span>.
You could connect an ergometer to your Famicom, enter your weight and age,
then pedal for 12 minutes. After uploading your pedalling data, you would receive 
a personalized exercise regimen.

## Legacy

While we never got the Famicom Network System in the West, Nintendo were actually
in talks with AT&T to set up a similar service in the United States. An NES
modem for playing the Minnesota State Lottery was tested but never released, due
to concerns about underage gambling.

With the onset of the [Lost Decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decades),
in the early 90s, the Japanese economy stagnated significantly. With much of the
Famicom network traffic at its peak being stock trading, the ensuing lack of
interest in stocks was the final nail in the coffin for a service that was already
difficult to set up and use.

The idea behind the Famicom Network never completely died out, as Nintendo would
come up with Satellaview, a similar service for the Super Famicom (known as the
Super Nintendo in the West). Satellaview allowed users to receive satellite
broadcasts with the Satellaview peripheral, and download games, magazines, and 
other media.

Being the most popular Famicom Network System application, the horse betting
terminal JRA-PAT was re-released for Satellaview. Eventually, as time marched on,
internet connectivity became the norm with consoles like the Sega Dreamcast,
which had an inbuilt modem and a version of JRA-PAT with [excellent music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeZw7qU2ju4).

Nowadays, we often take both our PCs and the internet for granted. But for a time,
not every home had a PC. You might just have a TV, a landline telephone, and your
trusty Famicom.

## Your game consoles are so much more

Even though Nintendo no longer makes game consoles to be general purpose computers,
most game consoles nowadays are essentially PCs with specialized gaming hardware.

The [original Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)) (short for DirectX Box),
is really just an x86 Intel Pentium PC with a customized version of Windows for gaming.

Linux on the Playstation 2 and 3 were *officially supported* by Sony with [PS2 Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_for_PlayStation_2)
and [OtherOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS). This was such a useful
feature that researchers built [compute clusters using PS3s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_cluster) to speed up black hole
simulations, cryptography research, and analyzing satellite imagery. When Sony
removed the OtherOS feature in 2010, a class-action lawsuit was brought against them,
proving that people really did care about Linux on their game consoles.

The Nintendo Switch is an ARM-based computer capable of dual-booting into Linux
and Android with [Switchroot](https://switchroot.org/). It's a nifty device that
you can carry around to do most things you'd do with a PC, and it even comes with
a convenient dock so you can connect it with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor when
you're at home.

The catch? Nintendo makes it as hard as humanly possible to do so. Developers had
to hack the device by [shorting two pins](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/hardware/researcher-discloses-unpatchable-nintendo-switch-exploit/)
on the Joycon connector to gain access the bootloader to install other OSes. When this was publicized, Nintendo changed the hardware so you now
need to [install a modchip](https://switch.hacks.guide/user_guide/modchip/) to do so, requiring incredibly precise soldering.

In our hands, we hold the ghost of Nintendo's dream. Nintendo once envisioned
a Nintendo computer in every home that would be your portal to the world's
information. In a way, Nintendo got that wish― it's just not profitable for them
anymore.
